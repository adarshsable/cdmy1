Classes are templates for objects.<br>
Javascript calls a constructor method when we create a new instance of a class.<br>
Inheritance is when we create a parent class with properties and methods that we can extend to child classes.<br>
We use the "extends" keyword to create a subclass.<br>
The super keyword calls the constructor() of a parent class.<br>
Static methods are called on the class, but not on instances of the class.<br>
